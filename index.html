        <h2 id="a">About Himself</h2>
        <p>Lionel Messi, often hailed as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has left an indelible mark on the
            sport through his unparalleled talent, extraordinary skill, and remarkable consistency. Born on June 24,
            1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi's journey to football stardom began at a young age when he joined the
            youth team of his local club, Newell's Old Boys.

            At the age of 13, Messi moved to Spain to join FC Barcelona's famed La Masia youth academy, where his
            exceptional abilities quickly became apparent. Making his first-team debut for Barcelona at just 17 years
            old in 2004, Messi soon established himself as a key player for the club, mesmerizing fans and opponents
            alike with his agility, vision, and goal-scoring prowess.

            Throughout his illustrious career at Barcelona, Messi amassed a staggering number of records and accolades.
            He became the club's all-time leading goal scorer, surpassing the legendary figures of the sport. Messi's
            unparalleled dribbling skills, precise passing, and instinctive ability to find the back of the net earned
            him numerous individual awards, including a record six Ballon d'Or titles, awarded to the world's best
            player.

            Notably, Messi's partnership with fellow Barcelona stars such as Xavi Hernández and Andrés Iniesta formed
            the backbone of one of the most dominant eras in football history. Under the guidance of iconic coaches like
            Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique, Barcelona won numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple
            UEFA Champions League trophies.

            Despite his immense success at Barcelona, Messi's career took an unexpected turn in 2021 when he left the
            club due to financial constraints and contractual disputes. He then joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where
            he continued to showcase his extraordinary talent on the pitch.

            In addition to his club success, Messi has also enjoyed considerable achievements with the Argentine
            national team. Despite facing criticism for his performances at the international level early in his career,
            Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2021 Copa America, securing his first major international trophy and
            cementing his legacy as one of the greatest players in football history.

            Beyond his on-field exploits, Messi is admired for his humility, professionalism, and philanthropy. He has
            used his platform to support numerous charitable causes, including children's healthcare and education
            initiatives.

            In summary, Lionel Messi's impact on football transcends statistics and trophies. His unique blend of skill,
            creativity, and determination has captivated audiences around the world, inspiring generations of
            footballers and earning him a place among the sport's all-time greats.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                Despite his dual citizenship and professional success in Spain, Messi’s ties with his homeland remained
                strong, and he was a key member of various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina’s
                victorious 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship squad, represented the country in the 2006 World Cup, and
                scored two goals in five matches as Argentina swept to the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
                Messi helped Argentina reach the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals, where the team was eliminated by Germany
                for the second consecutive time in World Cup play. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling
                display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team
                through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup
                final for the first time in 24 years. Argentina lost that contest 1–0 to Germany, but Messi nevertheless
                won the Golden Ball award as the tournament’s best player. During the 2016 Copa América Centenario
                tournament, he netted his 55th international goal to break Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentine scoring record.
                After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major
                tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted
                less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. At the 2018 World Cup, he
                helped an overmatched Argentine side reach the knockout stage, where they were eliminated by eventual
                champion France in their first match. After a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, Messi led
                Argentina to victory in the tournament two years later, and he received the Golden Ball award. His
                success continued at the 2022 World Cup. There he guided Argentina to the finals, where he scored two
                goals—and made a penalty kick during the shootout—to help defeat France. Messi won the World Cup’s
                Golden Ball, becoming the first male player to receive that award twice. In addition, his outstanding
                play in the tournament was instrumental in Messi winning his eighth Ballon d’Or in 2023.

            <h2>Messi's World Cup legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Messi scored seven goals at the 2022 World Cup, just one fewer than eventual Golden Boot winner Kylian
                Mbappe. He finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists (three) and key passes (21),
                and recorded more shots on target than any other player (13).

                The former PSG and Barcelona forward also became the first player in World Cup history to score in the
                group stage, last 16, quarter-final, semi-final and final at a single tournament - while picking up a
                record haul of five Man of the Match awards.

                When the time came to hand out the Golden Ball for the best player of the Qatar competition, there could
                only be one winner. Messi is now the only man to ever claim the prize twice, having also been recognised
                for his performances at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

                Messi has played at five World Cups in total, and is unmatched when it comes to overall goal
                contributions, with 13 goals and eight assists to his name. He also boasts the most appearances at the
                tournament on 26, one more than Germany icon Lothar Matthaus. Only three players have scored more World
                Cup goals than Messi - Miroslav Klose (16), Ronaldo Nazario (15), and Gerd Muller (14).

                For so long, Diego Maradona was the unrivalled hero to supporters across Argentina for masterminding
                their 1986 World Cup success. But Messi is no longer in his shadow, and the statistics prove that he is
                right up there with the greatest performers to have ever graced international football's most
                prestigious tournament.

                Lionel Messi's victory in the Copa America 2021 was a monumental moment in his illustrious career and
                for Argentine football as a whole. After years of near-misses and heartbreaks in international
                competitions, Messi finally lifted a major trophy with the Argentine national team.

                Throughout the tournament, Messi played a pivotal role in guiding Argentina to success. He led by
                example on the pitch, showcasing his exceptional skill, vision, and leadership qualities. Messi's
                performances were instrumental in Argentina's journey to the final, where they faced arch-rivals Brazil.

                In the final match against Brazil, held at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Messi delivered a
                masterclass performance, orchestrating Argentina's attacks and creating numerous goal-scoring
                opportunities. His determination and brilliance were evident throughout the game as he inspired his team
                to a hard-fought 1-0 victory over the host nation.

                The decisive moment of the final came in the 22nd minute when Angel Di Maria scored the only goal of the
                match, capitalizing on a sublime pass from Messi to beat the Brazilian goalkeeper. It was a moment of
                sheer joy and relief for Messi, his teammates, and millions of Argentine fans worldwide.

                With the victory in the Copa America 2021, Messi fulfilled a long-held dream of winning a major
                international trophy with Argentina. The triumph was particularly significant for Messi, who had faced
                criticism and scrutiny over his performances with the national team, despite his remarkable success at
                the club level.

                The Copa America victory solidified Messi's status as one of the greatest footballers of all time and
                cemented his legacy as a legend of Argentine football. It was a moment of redemption and glory for
                Messi, who had endured heartbreaks in previous international tournaments.

                For Argentine fans, the victory in the Copa America 2021 was a cause for celebration and jubilation,
                ending a 28-year wait for a major international trophy. Messi's heroics and leadership will be
                remembered as an integral part of Argentina's historic triumph in the Copa America 2021.
